        <h2>Zebras</h2>
        <pre>
Zebras (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: 
the Gr√©vy's zebra (Equus grevyi), plains zebra (E. quagga), and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus Equus 
with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different 
patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, with most evidence 
supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats
such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands, and mountainous areas.
